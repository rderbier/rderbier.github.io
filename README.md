##  work on Natural Language Processing

I have used a mix of NLP techniques and a concept of ontology to create a "Conversational" user interface where people can just ask questions about their data.
Presented at a user conference in 2018.

One of the key design decision in my NLP approach is to use a Graph Database as the underlying information storage. Graph technology is an effective choice when you don't know in advance the type of queries and "joins" that you have to support. That's usually the case in all businesses where different data are interconnected.

Here is an example of the conversational query using airline data about flight operations.

## work on Augmented Reality with Hololens

### The Bike challenge demo

At major events, we had a bike challenge and visitors could ride 30 seconds to do their best. Data is collected through sensors.
We extended this experience : a spectator can wear Microsoft Hololens and look at the challenge and see the performance data ...

A quick explainer of the type of data that we have included in the demo:

By implementing this first innovation project I realized that using enterprise data in the context of Augmented Reality has some very valid uses cases. The following is the introduction of the presentation I gave with a friend of mine at Global XR conference in 2020 on this subject.

The presentation also contained a "brief history of enterprise software architecture" which hopefully can help AR developers to better understand the enterprise software and data landscape (and it was fun to do !).
